The most difficult thing is I want to use Mac keymap on Windows but 【command】 is replaced with 【ctrl】.

# How to use me
## Find your location of user-defined keymaps
All user-defined keymaps are stored in separate configuration files under the config/keymaps subdirectory in the IntelliJ IDEA profile directory:

Windows and *NIX systems: `<User home>/.IntelliJ IDEA<xx>/config/keymaps`  
macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJ IDEA<xx>/keymaps`
  
Each keymap file contains only differences between the current and the parent keymaps.

## Copy config file into it
Put the Mac OS X 10_5 on Windows.xml file into folder named keymaps

## Restart IDEA
only restart

# !!!Important!!!
Close you QQ or something occupied your IDEA hotkeys
